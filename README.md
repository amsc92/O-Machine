The O-Machine is a machine that functions as an oracle to generate predictions from two different systems: a living system that uses Stichococcus algae, and a speculative system based on market fluctuations in cryptocurrencies.

Stichococcus algae are a type of blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria. They are responsible for the origin of life as we know it, as they have transformed the atmosphere of the Earth by producing oxygen, thus causing the great oxygenation event: the first mass extinction of non-anaerobic organisms. As a result of human activity and industry, blue-green algae are now overgrowing in the Baltic Sea, and their reproduction and decomposition are suffocating marine life.

The second system uses cryptocurrencies. This is a purely speculative system created by humans. Human technologies are currently causing massive changes in the Earth's system, including its atmosphere, leading to major species extinctions.

The O-Machine generates and confronts two predictions from these systems. In what can resemble a game, the data collected by the systems is translated into poems, which are printed when a ritualistic performance activates the machine.
